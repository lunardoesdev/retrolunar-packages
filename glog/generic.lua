        # symbolize_unittest, stacktrace_unittest and the rest), which is both
        # a cross-link problem and a set of target binaries we must never run.

        # drops its own command-line flag parsing (GLOG_USE_GFLAGS stays off).

        # one. Bionic's sysroot has no unwind.h or libunwind.h at all, so
        # find_package(Unwind) can only ever succeed on clang-native, where
        # it would pick up the HOST's libunwind, compile
        # stacktrace_libunwind-inl.h and bake -lunwind into
        # Libs.private (CMakeLists.txt:435-438) - while every Android family
        # would compile the generic backtrace path. Left at the upstream
        # default the artifact would differ per system. packages/libunwind
        # 1.8.3 exists but is deliberately not a dependency here; if the
        # tree ever wants native libunwind stack traces, that is a
        # per-system recipe, not this generic one.
        # WITH_SYMBOLIZE stays on (upstream default): it is glog's own ELF
        # symbolizer, needs no extra library, and is what makes
        # --symbolize_full stack traces work.

        # literal `Cflags: -I${includedir}` with no @variable@ in it, so no
        # cmake option reaches it, while CMakeLists.txt:416 makes
        # GLOG_USE_GLOG_EXPORT a PUBLIC compile definition of the target. A
        # find_package(glog) consumer therefore gets it for free through
        # INTERFACE_COMPILE_DEFINITIONS; a pkg-config consumer gets nothing,
        # and the header then hard-fails: logging.h:55-57 includes
        # glog/export.h only under `#if defined(GLOG_USE_GLOG_EXPORT)`, and
        # logging.h:59-61 is `#error <glog/logging.h> was not included
        # correctly` when GLOG_EXPORT or GLOG_NO_EXPORT is undefined. There
        # is no recipe-side alternative: the macro has to reach the consumer
        # as a compile flag, and the .pc Cflags line is the only channel a
        # pkg-config consumer reads.

        # is generated from; this is a post-install edit of a generated
        # artifact in our own staging directory, on the same lines the loader
        # already rewrites there for the same reason ($OUT to $PREFIX,
        # src/loader.lua:454-468). It is a plain substitution, not a patch,
        # and it is the only route: with no @variable@ in the Cflags line,
        # cmake has nothing to configure. A duplicate Cflags: key would not
        # do either - pkg-config resolves it last-key-wins, which drops the
        # -I rather than adding to it - so the existing line is rewritten.
        #
        # The added text contains no $OUT, so the loader's staged-.pc pass
        # takes its `*)` arm and prints this line verbatim. The rewrite
        # cannot double-apply: cmake --install regenerates the .pc from
        # libglog.pc.in on every build, so the input never already carries
        # the macro.
