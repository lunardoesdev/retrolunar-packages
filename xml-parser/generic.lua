        # XML::Parser is an XS module, so the split is:
        #   - Makefile.PL and xsubpp are build-time generators and must run
        #     under a NATIVE perl, taken from $NATIVE_PREFIX/bin (the same
        #     shape as gperf@native in packages/bison);
        #   - the XS sources they emit are then compiled by the Android
        #     cross-compiler into a target .so.
        # The loader exports NATIVE_PREFIX and puts it on PATH, so `perl` here
        # is the native one; nothing is hardcoded.
        #
        # The generated Makefile records the native perl's own -march/-O flags
        # and its CORE include dir, both x86-64, so OPTIMIZE/perl_inc are reset
        # to target-appropriate values on the make line. The whole make line
        # takes its values from the system - $CC, $LD and now $CFLAGS - with
        # only perl_inc and to_cflags being package-local corrections, each for
        # a stated Bionic reason. OPTIMIZE was a hardcoded "-O2 -fPIC" until
        # this pass, which was a stale copy of the systems' own defaults: it
        # silently dropped -DANDROID and the sysroot -isystem, and nothing
        # would have reported the drift if the systems changed their
        # optimisation level. The libc-only feature
        # macros that perl's CORE/config.h carries are turned off for the same
        # reason: Bionic has no crypt.h or shadow.h, and Bionic's <sys/sem.h>
        # already provides union semun, which perl.h would otherwise redefine.
