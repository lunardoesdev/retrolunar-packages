-- expect needs a Tcl library and headers for its LINK LINE, and a Tcl
-- interpreter for its BUILD-time script generation. Those are two different
-- Tcl installations and this recipe keeps them apart deliberately.
--
-- The interpreter: make install reaches $(SCRIPTS) through
-- install-libraries (Makefile.in:231), and $(SCRIPTS) runs
-- $(TCLSH) fixline1 to generate timed-run, timed-read, ftp-rfc, autopasswd,
-- lpunlock, weather and the rest (Makefile.in:35, :382-383). With
-- --with-tcl=$PREFIX/lib, TEA_PROG_TCLSH resolves TCLSH_PROG to
-- $PREFIX/bin/tclsh - the cross-compiled TARGET interpreter - so this would
-- execute an aarch64 binary on this x86-64 host, which is forbidden
-- outright. TCLSH_PROG is a plain '=' make variable (Makefile.in:172), so a
-- make command-line assignment overrides it and nothing else; the host
-- interpreter comes from tcl@native, which the loader puts on PATH and
-- exposes as $NATIVE_PREFIX.
--
-- The library and headers: --with-tcl also sets TCL_BIN_DIR, and
-- TEA_LOAD_TCLCONFIG then sources that directory's tclConfig.sh, which is
-- where TCL_LIB_SPEC, TCL_INCLUDE_SPEC and TCL_DEFS all come from
-- (tclconfig/tcl.m4:64-79, :357-360). Makefile.in:176 compiles every exp_*.c
-- with @TCL_INCLUDES@ and Makefile.in:396 links expect with @TCL_LIB_SPEC@.
-- So --with-tcl must stay on the TARGET prefix: pointing it at
-- $NATIVE_PREFIX would compile and link the aarch64 expect against x86-64
-- headers and libtcl, which is worse than the original problem because that
-- failure is silent. One lever cannot serve both jobs, so this recipe uses
-- --with-tcl for the link line and TCLSH_PROG for the interpreter.
--
-- Note the pkgIndex.tcl rule at Makefile.in:328-330 is the one that looks
-- alarming, but it is NOT in the install chain: `binaries` depends on
-- pkgIndex.tcl-hand (:217), which writes the file with plain shell echo and
-- runs no interpreter. install-lib-binaries only installs the file that
-- pkgIndex.tcl-hand already produced (:558-559).
