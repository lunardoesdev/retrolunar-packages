        # install rules and to generate easyloggingpp.pc.

        # There is NO CMake package config. CMakeLists.txt:69 is a bare
        # `export(PACKAGE Easyloggingpp)`, which writes nothing into $OUT -
        # there is no install(EXPORT) and no Config.cmake.in in the tree.
        # The pkg-config file is therefore the only discovery mechanism, which
        # is worth knowing before looking for a CMake config that is not there.

        # Note the layout: the header AND its implementation land side by side
        # in include/, because easylogging++ is the split-header form (the
        # library was separated into .h/.cc - see ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.md). A
        # consumer compiles easylogging++.cc into their own program rather
        # than linking a library from this prefix.
        #
        # test=OFF: already the default (CMakeLists.txt:24), passed
        # explicitly for the same reason as the others. With it ON, :78 does
        # find_package(GTest REQUIRED) and :87-100 builds a test executable -
        # a host program with no place in a target prefix.
        #
        # lib_utc_datetime stays OFF (:26, default). It only adds
        # -DELPP_UTC_DATETIME to THIS build's compile line (:57), and since
        # build_static_lib is off there is nothing to compile; a consumer who
        # wants UTC logging defines it themselves.
