        # (`typedef uint32_t in_addr_t`, bits/in_addr.h:40). glibc has no such
        # problem because its own netinet/in.h:30 carries the typedef, so
        # this is Android-only. Without it, arpa/inet.h:40 fails with
        # "unknown type name 'in_addr_t'" and libnl-3 does not compile at all.
        # This is a build-time define only: it is not baked into the shipped
        # headers, and consumers are unaffected because nothing shadows
        # <linux/in.h> outside libnl's own tree. It restores exactly the
        # definition Bionic would have supplied.
