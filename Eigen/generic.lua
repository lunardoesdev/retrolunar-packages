        # the test suite; EIGEN_BUILD_DOC (line 80) - doxygen; EIGEN_BUILD_DEMOS
        # (line 82) - example programs; EIGEN_BUILD_BLAS and EIGEN_BUILD_LAPACK
        # (lines 63-64) - the bundled LAPACK/BLAS helper libraries, which are
        # Fortran/C host builds with no place in a target prefix. The two
        # benchmark suites (lines 72-73) already default OFF.
        #
        # EIGEN_BUILD_PKGCONFIG and EIGEN_BUILD_CMAKE_PACKAGE stay ON (lines
        # 86, 88): both are how consumers find the headers, and Eigen has no
        # compiled artifact that could be wrong-arch.

        # install(DIRECTORY Eigen DESTINATION include) at line 236 is what
        # copies the WHOLE header tree - Eigen/src, Eigen/unsupported and all -
        # which is why this recipe runs upstream's own install rather than
        # copying headers by hand.
