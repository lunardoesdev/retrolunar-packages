        # only archive built is the static one, liblexbor_static.a
        # (CMakeLists.txt:211-221, installed by config.cmake:345-353). Every
        # pkg-config consumer would be told to link a library that is not in
        # the prefix. The template has no @variable@ a cmake option could
        # redirect - the substitute is the project name and nothing else - so
        # no LEXBOR_* flag fixes it.

        # cmake --install wrote into $OUT is our own build output, on the same
        # lines the loader already rewrites there for the same reason ($OUT to
        # $PREFIX, src/loader.lua:454-468). packages/glog/generic.lua:68-69 is
        # the worked example of exactly this shape. It is a plain
        # substitution of one generated field, not a patch.

        # resolves a repeated key last-key-wins, which would drop the -L
        # rather than add to it. The -L${libdir} is kept. The replacement text
        # contains no $OUT, so the loader's staged-.pc pass prints it verbatim,
        # and the rewrite cannot double-apply because cmake --install
        # regenerates the .pc from lexbor.pc.in on every build.
