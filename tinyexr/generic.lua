        #                        TINYEXR_USE_MINIZ defaults to 1
        #   libtinyexr.a         carries undefined mz_compress,
        #                        mz_compressBound and mz_uncompress, which
        #                        the separately built libminiz.a supplies

        # a prefix nothing can compile against, which is why all three extra
        # files are copied here rather than left to a future reader.
