        # tests and demos are host program suites (meson.build:602-612 pulls in
        # test/ and demos/, and demos additionally want gtk+-3.0 and glib-2.0
        # per meson.build:443-444). libpng feeds only the test suite
        # (meson.build:447-465), so it goes with them. gtk is the demos'
        # dependency and is disabled for the same reason.

        # openmp defaults to auto and resolves to NDK's libomp on Android,
        # which would set USE_OPENMP (meson.build:431-435); its only consumer

        # neither of which this build produces.

        # (meson.build:27), and this prefix ships optimised static archives.
