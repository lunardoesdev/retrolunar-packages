-- heaptrack WILL NOT BUILD in this prefix. It is a KDE/Qt application and
-- there is no Qt here: packages/ contains no qt, qt5, qt6 or base, which was
-- checked by listing, not assumed. Everything below is therefore written to
-- be correct in shape but is NOT expected to configure. See stage1.md.
--
-- The one thing that would make this build is a Qt 6 package in this prefix.
-- It deliberately does NOT `require("qt6")`: the loader would fail at
-- require() time with a package-not-found error, which hides the real reason
-- and produces a worse diagnostic than the configure failure below.
--
-- The Qt component list has NOT been verified against upstream's build files.
-- The release archive could not be fetched (see source.lua and stage1.md), so
-- no component names are guessed here.
