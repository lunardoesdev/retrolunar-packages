# lapack build forecast — **WILL NOT BUILD on any system here**

- Recipe: `generic.lua`, source `source.lua`
- Version pinned: 3.12.1 (`https://www.netlib.org/lapack/lapack-3.12.1.tar.gz`,
  8067105 bytes, matches the server's Content-Length). The GitHub project
  `Reference-LAPACK/lapack` tags v3.12.1 but publishes **no release assets**
  (`api.github.com/.../releases` shows an empty `assets` list for v3.12.1,
  v3.12.0, v3.11.0 and v3.10.1), so netlib is the only real tarball.
- Build system: **cmake only**. The tree ships **no** `configure`, no
  `configure.ac`, no `aclocal.m4`, no `config.h.in` and no `Makefile.in` —
  verified against a complete 6697-member extraction, not inferred from a
  failed grep. It does ship a hand-written `Makefile`, plus `BLAS/` (C),
  `CBLAS/` (C) and `SRC/` (**2038 Fortran `.f` files**).
- Config template: none.
- The decisive line is `CMakeLists.txt:313`.

## Verification of the tree these claims come from

6697 archive members, 6697 paths on disk, name-set diff zero missing and zero
extra. `CMakeLists.txt` is 26164 bytes and every line cited was read from the
file on disk. `/tmp` on this machine is a tmpfs with an exhausted user quota
that truncates writes silently while `df` still reports space free, so this
whole forecast was taken from a verified tree under `/home`.

## The blocker

**LAPACK's reference implementation unconditionally enables the Fortran
language, and this repo has no Fortran compiler for any target.**

`CMakeLists.txt:309-313`:

```cmake
if(NOT LATESTLAPACK_FOUND)
  message(STATUS "Using supplied NETLIB LAPACK implementation")
  set(LAPACK_LIBRARIES ${LAPACKLIB})

  enable_language(Fortran)
```

That `enable_language(Fortran)` is not inside any `if(CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER)`
guard. That is not an oversight in the branch structure either — the
neighbouring branches *do* guard, which is what makes :313 clearly deliberate:
`:283-287` wraps its own `enable_language(Fortran)` in
`if(CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER)` after `check_language(Fortran)`, and `:301-305`
has an `else()` that says in as many words "CMake couldn't find a Fortran
compiler, so it cannot check if the provided LAPACK library works" and then
optimistically sets `LATESTLAPACK_FOUND TRUE`. The reference path has no such
escape.

On top of that, `:320-330` compiles Fortran timing sources
(`second_${TIME_FUNC}.f`, `dsecnd_${TIME_FUNC}.f`) via `CheckTimeFunction`.

The three ways around it, and why each is closed:

- **Turn off the Fortran side.** Closed by `CMakeLists.txt:215-219`:
  `if(NOT (BUILD_SINGLE OR BUILD_DOUBLE OR BUILD_COMPLEX OR BUILD_COMPLEX16))`
  is a `FATAL_ERROR` ("Nothing to build, no precision selected"). Those four
  options are the Fortran LAPACK library; all four off means no library.
- **Supply an external LAPACK.** That is the `LATESTLAPACK_FOUND` path, and
  it is closed by the same missing Fortran compiler at `:286`, plus the fact
  that there is no LAPACK in this prefix to supply (see below).
- **Build only the C parts.** Not expressible: `:313` runs on the way to
  building anything, before `BLAS/` or `SRC/` is even reached.

And the compiler does not exist, on any of the six systems:

| check | result |
|---|---|
| systems exporting `$FC`, `$F77` or `$FLIBS` | **zero**, across all 58 system directories in `packages/*/generic.lua` |
| Fortran compiler in the NDK (`ndk/28.2.13676358`) | **none**; 181 tools in `toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/linux-x86_64/bin`, no gfortran/flang/f77 |
| Fortran compiler on this build host | **none**; `gfortran`, `flang`, `f77`, `g77` are all absent from `PATH` |

| system | verdict | reason |
|---|---|---|
| aarch64-android21 | WILL NOT BUILD | `CMakeLists.txt:313` calls `enable_language(Fortran)` unguarded in the reference-implementation branch, and cmake aborts there when it cannot find a Fortran compiler. The NDK ships none, and no system exports `$FC`. Unreachable at any API level — this is a toolchain fact, not a libc one. |
| aarch64-android24 | WILL NOT BUILD | As above. |
| aarch64-android35 | WILL NOT BUILD | As above. |
| x86_64-android35 | WILL NOT BUILD | As above. |
| x86_64-mingw | WILL NOT BUILD | As above. mingw-w64 ships gcc/g++, not a Fortran compiler, and no system exports `$FC`. |
| clang-native | WILL NOT BUILD | As above. clang-native exports `$CC` and `$CXX` but no `$FC`, and there is no gfortran or flang on the build host. |

**API level notes.** None apply. This is a toolchain blocker, not a libc one,
so it is identical at API 21, 24 and 35, and identical on mingw and native.
The API-21 walls, the 26/28/35 gates and `armv7a`/`i686` are all irrelevant
here: LAPACK never gets as far as compiling any C.

**Risks / what a reviewer should check.**

1. **The recipe refuses immediately, and that refusal is the honest
   expression of the blocker.** `generic.lua` contains no cmake invocation
   at all: it prints a six-line explanation naming `CMakeLists.txt:313` and
   exits 1. An earlier draft of this recipe carried three runnable
   `cmake` lines with the blocker recorded only in a comment above them,
   which is a recipe that *looks* buildable and fails deeper in — a comment
   is not a guard. The package is now impossible to mistake for a build
   regression, and the refusal costs nothing to run. **A builder who hits it
   should record the refusal and stop; it is not a regression to work
   around, and it must not be "fixed" by installing a Fortran compiler.**
   `topackage.md:298` stays unchecked; that file should record the blocker in
   the same style as the other blocked entries (e.g. `:70` Pkgconf, `:20`
   Elfutils) — I was told not to edit it.
2. **This is a system-level gap, not a package defect.** The single missing
   thing is a *target* Fortran compiler: a `$FC` exported by the system
   files, in the same spirit as the `ac_cv_func_ffsl` export AGENTS.md
   describes for the Android systems. That is outside one package's scope, so
   it is recorded here for the director rather than worked around. It is also
   almost certainly the wrong fix — see the cheaper route at the end of this
   document.
3. **The version is slightly inconsistent upstream.** `CMakeLists.txt:5-7`
   reads `LAPACK_MINOR_VERSION 12` / `LAPACK_PATCH_VERSION 0` in the 3.12.1
   tarball, so upstream forgot to bump its own CMake version string. Irrelevant
   to the blocker, but worth knowing before anyone trusts
   `pkg-config --modversion lapack` as a 3.12.1 check.
4. **If a Fortran compiler is ever added to the systems, the recipe is not
   automatically correct.** The open questions are whether the f2c-converted
   LAPACK or the real Fortran sources are wanted, and whether `CBLAS` should be
   on (`option(CBLAS "Build CBLAS" OFF)` at `:259`, so the recipe turns it on
   explicitly). `LAPACKE` defaults OFF at `:344` and is only forced on at
   `:349-351` when `LAPACKE_WITH_TMG` is set — it is **not** forced by the
   reference-implementation branch, which is what a fast read of that region
   suggests. Also open: whether OpenBLAS from this same prefix should be
   handed over via `USE_OPTIMIZED_BLAS`/`USE_OPTIMIZED_LAPACK` instead.
   Those are design decisions for whoever revisits this, not something to
   settle now.

**What would have to become true to unblock it.** One of:

- a system file exporting a *target* Fortran compiler (`$FC`) for every system
  that needs it — this is a **system-level** addition, in the same spirit as
  the `ac_cv_func_ffsl` export AGENTS.md describes for the Android systems;
  or
- a decision to consume OpenBLAS's f2c-converted LAPACK (which *is* C, and
  which `openblas/generic.lua` here builds with `NOFORTRAN=1`) instead of
  building Reference-LAPACK at all. That is the cheaper path and is worth
  raising before anyone adds a Fortran compiler.
