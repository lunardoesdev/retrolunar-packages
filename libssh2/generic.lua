        # backend list in order and the first one whose headers and library
        # link wins, so which backend gets chosen would depend on what else is
        # visible in $PREFIX. OpenSSL is the only one of the five this prefix
        # can satisfy (libgcrypt, mbedtls, gnutls and wolfssl aside, openssl
        # is the package present), and naming it is what makes the .pc's
        # Requires.private: libcrypto deterministic.
        # --with-libz: the in-prefix zlib. configure.ac:157 probes it with
        # AC_LIB_HAVE_LINKFLAGS([z]), so leaving it on auto would silently
        # disable compression if the probe failed.
        # --disable-examples-build turns off the sample client/server, which
        # are host programs; configure.ac:289 makes this the default ON.
        # --disable-docker-tests and --disable-sshd-tests keep the test
        # harness from wanting a container or an sshd (configure.ac:274,281).
