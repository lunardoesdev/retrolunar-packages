-- squashfs-tools 4.7.2 is a hand-written Makefile, NOT autotools: there is no
-- configure, no configure.ac and no config template of any name in the tree.
-- Compressor support is a set of Makefile variables, and every one that is on
-- adds a library to LIBS:
--   gzip -> -lz (Makefile:276), lz4 -> -llz4 (:300), xz -> -llzma (:317),
--   zstd -> -lzstd (:329), lzo -> -llzo2 (:288).
-- The compressors that have a package in this prefix are required; the one
-- that does not (lzo) is switched off below rather than dropped silently.
