        # adds ASan/UBSan flags to the Debug config, and we never build Debug.

        # probes for the C23 "nodiscard" attribute and, when the probe
        # succeeds, switches the whole build to -std=c23, which upstream's own
        # comment calls out as a mode that "may fail". C99 is what the project
        # asks for everywhere else in the file, so ask for it explicitly.

        # system would land in C23 mode.)
